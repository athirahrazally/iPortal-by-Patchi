**Main Entities:**
- Administrator
- Teacher
- Student
- Class
- Exam
- Attendance

**Key Relationships:**
- Administrator manages Classes
- Students enroll in Classes
- Teachers teach Classes
- Exams belong to Classes
- Attendance records link Students and Classes

**System Diagrams**

*Sequence Diagram (Teacher Workflow)*
1. Teacher logs into the system
2. System validates credentials via database
3. Teacher selects a class
4. System fetches class data
5. Teacher enters student marks
6. Data is saved into the database
7. Confirmation is returned to the teacher
